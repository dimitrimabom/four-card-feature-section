## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- SCSS

### What I learned

I've rediscovered how grids work. what caused me a bit of trouble was aligning the blocks with the grids. this code helped me a lot.

```css
.cards {
  grid-template-areas:
    "card_1 card_2 card_4"
    "card_1 card_3 card_4";
}
```
